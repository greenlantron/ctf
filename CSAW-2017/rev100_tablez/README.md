## tableEZ (Reversing, 100 points, 342 solves)

    Bobby was talking about tables a bunch, so I made some table stuff. I think this is what he was talking about...

A simple lookup table. Extracting both the encoded flag and table into python quickly allows us to reverse the operation.  Solution in [tablEZ.py](tablEZ.py).

`flag{t4ble_l00kups_ar3_b3tter_f0r_m3}`
